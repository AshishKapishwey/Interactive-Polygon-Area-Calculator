# Interactive Polygon Area Calculator

## Project Overview
This is a Java-based project for an **Interactive Polygon Area Calculator**. It includes a graphical user interface and modular classes to calculate and visualize the area of polygons (three and four side polygon) interactively. The project demonstrates key OOM concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Allows users to draw polygons interactively.
- **Polygon Area Calculation:** Calculates the area of polygons based on vertex inputs.
- **Modular Code Structure:** The project is divided into multiple classes like `Main`, `Vertex`, `Angles`, `Length`, and `DrawPanel`.
- **Interactive Elements:** Supports dynamic drawing, calculation, and display panels.
- **Resource Management:** Handles images like `logo.png` efficiently.
